*Historical Immersion Project: support software toolkit*

## Summary ##

This repository holds various support tools for the Crusader Kings II Historical Immersion Project, not only those global to the project (e.g., the HIP installer or generic CKII modding utilities) but also module-specific tools (e.g., automated culture splitting for SWMH or code generators for Project Balance).

## Copying ##

All software within this repository uses, unless explicitly stated otherwise in the tool's source files, the MIT License (see: LICENSE).

## Collaboration ##

Programmers within the HIP team all have direct collaboration rights to the repository.  Make sure you're "watching" the repository on GitHub if you want to see notifications of all commits.  Otherwise, it is expected that you'll look at commit histories as needed, as in a traditional development team environment.

Pull requests will be freely accepted from the public so long as they meet HIP's needs and confirm to appropriate style guidelines.  It may take a round or two of back-and-forth before your pull request is merged in these cases.
