======================================
HIP: GENERAL INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
======================================

1. If you have a "modules" subfolder in your mod folder, delete it completely. It's from a past release and
WILL interfere with a clean installation of the new version if not removed.

2. Unzip *everything* inside the downloaded .7z archive directly into your mod folder. You need an archiving
utility like 7-Zip (free, open source, cross-platform) to unzip .7z files effectively.

3. If installing on Mac or Linux, proceed to those platforms' specific instructions below. If installing on
Windows, continue.

4. Run HIP.exe, which was unzipped directly into your mod folder. This is the automatic installer.

5. The installation process is brief, but if you are new to it, do take care to read through your options
(they are many) and pay attention to everything the installer tells you (it's important).

6. Start CKII and enable the "HIP - Historical Immersion Project" mod in the launcher.

7. Play!

NOTES:

- If your installation dies mid-way through the compilation with some type of filesystem error (e.g.,
permission denied), make sure you've enough disk space and strongly consider temporarily disabling your
antivirus software's active protection. This is uncommon overall, but it's still one of the most common user
issues among the few.

- NEVER EVER post a bug report without your "version.txt" file, which is dynamically generated by the HIP
installer every time you run it. The installer places the file inside of the compiled mod's folder (and when
installation is done, explicitly shows you the path). This is absolutely critical for us to be able to help
you, fix a bug, or generally understand you.


=====================
Mac OS X Installation
=====================

1. Complete steps (1)-(3) in the general installation instructions at the top of this file.

2. Find the application Terminal that comes with your Mac. It is impossible to uninstall and bundled with
every Mac. If it's not on your Launcher already, then search Finder under Applications for Terminal. It should
be in a subfolder in Applications with other system utilities. Run Terminal.

3. The Terminal application will start in your home directory. The following command assumes that Terminal is
still located in your home directory.

Copy and then paste the following line of text, precisely, into the Terminal window, and then hit ENTER:

python "Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py"

4. You should now be running the automatic installer, and your experience should be identical to that of
Windows/Linux. Resume at step (5) in the general install instructions at the top of this file.


==================
Linux Installation
==================

1. Complete steps (1)-(3) in the general installation instructions at the top of this file.

2. Open a terminal window. There are many terminal applications available for Linux, and if you're running
Linux, you probably know how to access at least one. The gist is that we're going to hit up the command
line, so open up a new terminal window.

3. Copy and then paste the following line of text, precisely, into the terminal window, and then hit ENTER:

python ~/.paradoxinteractive/"Crusader Kings II"/mod/main.py

4. You should now be running the automatic installer, and your experience should be identical to that of
Windows/Mac. Resume at step (5) in the general install instructions at the top of this file.


================================================
Troubleshooting with a Terminal / Command Prompt
================================================

If you experience any problems running the installer and are comfortable using a terminal / command prompt,
then execute the following commands in your terminal / command prompt _from your home directory_. Then
copy/paste their output into your bug report / question on the forums:

On Mac or Windows, try running this (copy/paste to make sure you don't make any syntax mistakes):

python "Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py" -V

On Linux, you'd want to run this instead:

python ~/.paradoxinteractive/"Crusader Kings II"/mod/main.py -V

If that works, copy all the output from that command (scroll up if you have to do so) into your forum /
Discord post. That should tells us everything we need to know about your system, python version, HIP installer
version, etc.

If that doesn't work, the file "main.py" that you were supposed to extract into your mod folder probably isn't
where we expect it to be for some reason.  Indicate in your post if you have a non-standard mod folder
location, as that would break these instructions. Check for a "main.py" wherever you DID extract the 7zip
archive. Was that in the right place?  Finally, what output *does* Terminal give you instead of running the
installer?

If the installer ran but could not complete or did something obviously broken mid-way through, try running it
this way and repeating the steps that made it crash/error:

[Mac/Windows]: python "Documents/Paradox Interactive/Crusader Kings II/mod/main.py" -D

[Linux]: python ~/.paradoxinteractive/"Crusader Kings II"/mod/main.py -D

This should generate a file called HIP_debug.log in your mod folder which you can attach on the forums,
Discord, or any other place where HIP offers support.
